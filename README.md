# Motor-Trend-Magazine-Project
Motor Trend is a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
    "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
    "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
    
The goal of this project is to answer their questions.
